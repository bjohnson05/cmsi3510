 * filename   : evenOddTable.c
 * purpose    : demonstrate "C" code for practice
 * author     : Dr. Johnson
 * date       : 2019-01-17
 * description:
 *    1. Write a program to vary the value of an integer variable i
 *          from -10 to +10 and output a simple table.
 *    2. For each value, print i as well as the value of i times i.
 *    3. Also print out whether i is even or odd by displaying the
 *          word EVEN or ODD at the end of each line.
 *    4. Separate the output into columns to make a table using the
 *          tab character "\t".
 *    5. Count the number of EVEN and ODD values, and display the
 *          counts at the end of the table after a blank line.
 *    6. Try to make all the output columns line up neatly. You can
 *          decide whether they are left- or right- justified.
 *          Left is easier, but right looks nicer for the numbers.
